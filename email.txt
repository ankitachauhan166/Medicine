Hi 

I have replicated the mock up and also made it responsive. I have used Bootstrap 4. 
For animation I have given heartbeat effect to Add to Cart button with respect to medicine.
For javascript I have written script to count the number of items added to cart as the user click the button. 
The text message which is otherwise hidden, displays on screen telling the user how many items have been added to cart.
I have used google chrome browser for reference while development.

Javascript Debug 

one of the errors which says Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token { ".on('finish.countdown', function {"
fix for this would be ".on('finish.countdown', function() {"

format for function is function() { code ....}

for other error which says Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'click' of undefined
<script>
        pop.click(function(){
             $('.shadowarea').fadeIn();
        });
        var pop = $('.pop');
        x.click(function(){$('.shadowarea').fadeOut();});
  </script>
  
  var pop is defined after it is being used.
  even if javascript supports hoisting pop could have been assigned some value to start with. the fix for this is would be
  <script>
		pop = $('.pop');
        pop.click(function(){
             $('.shadowarea').fadeIn();
        });
        var pop;
        x.click(function(){$('.shadowarea').fadeOut();});
  </script>
  
 The error Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined for define(["jquery"],a):a(jQuery)}(function(a)
as the error says jQery has not been defined. In order to use the jQuery we need to first define it.
